I want a wep app (with php & sqlite) to track visitors on my website, i want to start simple with a dashboard with two tab:First tab Traffic
with a stacked bar chart to view the number of visitors (only uniq view),returning visitors and bots 
(bot at the bottom in red,new visitor in the middle in green and returning visitor at the top in blue) and next to it a litle table to see visitor comming
to my website in live with time,page view and event tracked (on mouse over each line show (without delay a tooltip with all data gathered).
The second tab will be setting where you will put a script snippet linking to the javascript code that will handle event tracking.
Also make a small web site in a folder named "fake_website" to test it, use playwright for the e2e test.
Gather this data for each event: 
Timestamp (milisecond),ID (ip+user agent hash),Event_Type,Page,Referrer,Country (get from the 2 letters country code in javascript local() ),OS,Browser,Device_Type(PC,MOBILE),Resolution,Timezone,Page Load (load time in ms),isBot (if user agent match known crawler/bots),User Agent
